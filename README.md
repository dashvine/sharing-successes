# Sharing Successes

You can access our [Documentation here](https://github.com/dashvine/sharing-successes-docs).

Also, in the repository there's the file t3-guide.md which shows what and how-to-use the stack of this project.

We are using only [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) from T3 stack, however we acknowledge that both [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) are pretty good as well.
